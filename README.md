# hackCityTwo

First Attempt at creating my app with a few friends. The app is a social media site for developers and designers. The purpose of the app is to team up with link minded people who are interested in collaborating at hackathons. The app shows meet-ups, teams, and has a chat feature so you can meet your teammates and brainstrom before the hackathon begins. This app will be rebuilt in the future with added features.
